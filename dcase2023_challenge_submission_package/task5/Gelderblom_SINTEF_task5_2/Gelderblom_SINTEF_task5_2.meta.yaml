  # System complexity, meta data provided here will be used to evaluate

  complexity:

    # Total amount of parameters used in the acoustic model. For neural networks, this
    # information is usually given before training process in the network summary.
    # For other than neural networks, if parameter count information is not directly available,
    # try estimating the count as accurately as possible.
    # In case of ensemble approaches, add up parameters for all subsystems.
    total_parameters: 90M    # note that for simple template matching, the "parameters"==the pixel count of the templates, plus 1 for each param such as thresholding.
